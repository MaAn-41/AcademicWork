# Project Title

Landing Page or Sign In, Sign Up Page

## About Project


A landing page is a targeted web page designed to capture the attention of visitors who clicked on an ad, email, or other digital marketing campaign. Unlike a general website page, a landing page has a single, focused goal called a call to action (CTA). This CTA could be anything from signing up for a free trial to making a purchase.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Standalone: Exists outside the main navigation of a website.
* Targeted: Designed for a specific marketing campaign.
* Focused: Has one clear goal (e.g., sign up, buy now).
* Compelling: Uses text, visuals, and benefits to encourage the desired action.

## Appendix

Sign-in/Sign-up pages act as the entry point for users. Existing users log in with credentials, while new users register to create accounts and access full features. Often combined, the page offers clear labels and sometimes features like social sign-in and password reset. In short, it's the account management hub for users to enter the platform.
