Responsive Webpage

## About Project


A responsive web page is a design approach that ensures websites look good and function well on all devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. It uses a combination of HTML and CSS to automatically adjust the layout, content, and images based on the screen size of the device being used. This allows for a seamless user experience regardless of the platform, improving accessibility and user satisfaction.

## Appendix

Sign-in/Sign-up pages act as the entry point for users. Existing users log in with credentials, while new users register to create accounts and access full features. Often combined, the page offers clear labels and sometimes features like social sign-in and password reset. In short, it's the account management hub for users to enter the platform.
